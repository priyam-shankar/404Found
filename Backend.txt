Q.   what is backened ?
Ans: it consist 3 things.
    (i) Server : basically it is a computer
    (ii) The Application :  which have all logic to enables the web page to function
    (iii) Database : we can store and retrieve user data


  1. Server:
            it is a computer.
            server is On 24/7 => it can listens the incoming requests from browser all the over the world 
            Any Computer which connected to the internet, we called it server.
            but when use to create a web page only on our computer like local host then our computer acts like a server.

  2. Application : 
                 it is basically the logic that runs on that computer, the server.
                 and this logic deteremines how we want to respond to the request from the browser.  

   3. Database :
               Usually our wep apps gets more complex and larger => we start to store the user data.
               Assume if our computer lost power and you didn't have any sort of databse, then all of that data will get completely wiped. 
               So that's we use the database as form of permananet storage for your web application.



   PROCESS:-

        Web page(HTML,CSS,JS)  ----> requested from Browser --------> Our web page server --------> returns the HTML file ---------> render on the browser.    

   WEB PAGE FUNCTIONALITY

        user (Login by -> email & password) ----->    these 2 information(email,pass) ------>  passed to our server in a request ------> find Apllication (which knows the logic i.e which knows how to handle the LOGIN) in this file there is a logic like how to login a user -------> we could look to our logic and our logic is pretty simple ----------> we look inside our databases , look for a particular (email & pass) and we can compare that pass that's in the databases for user's email against the pass that they send us from the frontened.  if those two pieces of data match,---------> then we can send back via the server, -----> in a response ------> in the form of , say the Home Page.  -------> and if didm't match the pass -------> then maybe our response would be to send them back to the login page and try agin.

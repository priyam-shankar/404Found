❓ What is Backend?
     The backend is the part of a web application that powers everything behind the scenes. It mainly consists of three core components:

1️⃣ Server
     A server is simply a computer that's always connected to the internet and stays ON 24/7.
     Its main job is to listen for incoming requests from browsers around the world.
     Even your own computer can act as a server when you're developing locally (e.g., using localhost).

2️⃣ Application (Logic Layer)
     The application is the logic that runs on the server.
     It handles the incoming requests and decides how to respond to each one.
     For example, when a user tries to log in, this application knows what to do with that login request.

3️⃣ Database
     As web apps become more complex, we need a place to store and retrieve user data.
     A database provides permanent storage.
     Without a database, if the server restarts or loses power, all the data would be lost.
     That's why we use databases — to keep user data safe and persistent.

⚙️ Backend Process Flow:
     Browser (requests HTML/CSS/JS) 
               ↓
     Server receives the request
               ↓
     Server returns the HTML file
               ↓
     Browser renders the web page


🔐 Web Page Functionality Example – User Login:
     Let’s say a user tries to log in using email and password:
          1.The user enters their credentials in the frontend (login page).
          2.This data is sent to the server as a request.
          3.The application logic on the server processes the login:
               => It checks the database for the given email.
               => It compares the password stored in the database with the one sent from the frontend.

          4.If both match:
               => The server sends a response with the Home Page (login successful).

          5.If the credentials don’t match:
               => The server sends back the login page again, asking the user to retry.

🧠 Summary:
     Backend = Server + Application + Database
     It powers the brain of any web application.
     Handles all the data, logic, and communication between frontend and backend.
